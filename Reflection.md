# Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?

Yes. I used Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT and Windsurf to help me with some syntax, autocomplete, errors, how to use some libraries such as Passport and how to deploy to Railway.

# What did you build or decide manually?

I decided manually to use NestJS, Guards, Class Validator and Prisma and I made the whole CRUD manually after the initial scafold of Nest CLI generate resource commands. In addition to this I made the deploy to Railway manually after following Claude's instructions.

# Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?

I had to think critically about the endpoints, validations and the CRUD part.

# What would you improve with more time?

I'd add documentation with Swagger, Unit tests and improve validations and the JWT signature as well as encrypt the token.
